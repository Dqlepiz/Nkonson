Our passion and zeal towards helping the world to be a better place comes from personal experiences and careful observations of how some areas of this life seems to be weakening day by day. Our 3 main areas we are focused on are as follows:
1-	Educating and Caring for Orphans and helping to make them better people to the society.
2-	Educating and helping pregnant women who donâ€™t have the access to good and quality      healthcare and facilities.
3-	Providing Proper waste management places for rural areas.","Charity,Foundation,NGO,Service,Volutary",NGO,1-5,233245074439,Yeboah C Alfred,http://www.ghanayello.com/company/49232/Watered_Kindness_Foundation/contacts,"Abe Close, Nyamekye Lapaz., Accra, Ghana","Public & Social services,Public & Social services / Charity services,Public & Social services / Children's services,Public & Social services / Social services,Public & Social services / Voluntary organisations",2017,http://www.ghanayello.com/company/49232/Watered_Kindness_Foundation,2017-10-30 16:30:36.637054,Watered Kindness Foundation
